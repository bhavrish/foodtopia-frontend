# Foodtopia - Frontend

**Foodtopia** is a platform which customers can use to have food be delivered to their home and a restaurant can use to find customers seamlessly. 

There are 6 types of users in our system: surfers, regular customers, VIP customers, delivery people, chefs, and managers. Surfers can browse menu items but are unable to do anything else until they register and their account is approved. Registered customers can order food, review delivery people, chefs, and food quality, and potentially become a VIP customer. In addition to all of the perks of being a customer, VIPs can order food at a 10% discount, their reviews/ratings count twice as much as that of a regular customer, and they have access to special dishes. Meanwhile, the application also provides managers with an interface from which they can manage virtually everything on the application.

The web application works as follows: a surfer registers to become a regular user with their personal information. Once the manager approves the user, the surfer becomes a regular user and is able to make orders. After a transaction is completed, the user can review the delivery person and chef. The delivery person can also review their customers. For a variety of reasons, managers can issue warnings and deregister regular customers or remove the VIP status of VIP customers.

Backend Repo: https://github.com/zealptl/swe-project-backend

It was developed by Bhavesh Shah, Zeal Patel, Greg Kimatov, Yihui Wuchen, and Victoria Yang for our Software Engineering class.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
